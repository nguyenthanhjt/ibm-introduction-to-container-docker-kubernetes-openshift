# README: [Introduction to Containers w/ Docker, Kubernetes & OpenShift] documentation

----

Welcome to my learning repository for the [IBM - Introduction to Containers w/ Docker, Kubernetes & OpenShift](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ibm-containers-docker-kubernetes-openshift) Certificate. 

This repository is created to document and track my progress as I journey through the courses.

Whether you're a fellow learner, a potential employer, or someone interested in these fields, feel free to explore the content and contribute.

## Purpose

This repository serves several purposes:

- Record Learning Progress: Every section of each course is meticulously documented to track my learning journey. It helps me keep a clear record of what I've learned and achieved.

- Reference Material: All relevant content and resources, including notes, code snippets, and additional references, are compiled for easy access. This creates a valuable reference for future projects or for revisiting concepts.

- Self-Documentation: Keypoints and insights are captured based on my understanding. This self-documentation aids in reinforcing concepts, making it a valuable resource for personal review.
