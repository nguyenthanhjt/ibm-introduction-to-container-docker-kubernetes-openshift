00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:10.400
Welcome to introduction
to Red Hat OpenShift.

2
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.940
After watching this video,

3
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.020
you will be able to explain what

4
00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.290
OpenShift is and
list its features,

5
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.360
describe OpenShift
CLI, architecture,

6
00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.175
and components, and compare
OpenShift with Kubernetes.

7
00:00:23.175 --> 00:00:26.100
OpenShift, developed and
supported by Red Hat,

8
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.135
is an enterprise-ready
Kubernetes container platform

9
00:00:29.135 --> 00:00:31.320
built for the hybrid
Cloud strategy.

10
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.800
It provides a consistent

11
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.915
application platform
to manage hybrid,

12
00:00:34.915 --> 00:00:37.200
multi-Cloud, and
edge deployments.

13
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.260
It is built on the
technological foundation

14
00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.740
of Linux, containers,
and automation.

15
00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.380
It provides full stack
automated operations

16
00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:45.840
and self-service provisioning

17
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.640
for developers to
efficiently move

18
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.135
ideas from development
to production.

19
00:00:50.135 --> 00:00:53.160
Besides container
orchestration, it provides

20
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.460
additional tooling around

21
00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.690
the complete life
cycle of applications.

22
00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.950
From build, to CI/CD,

23
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.800
to monitoring, and logs.

24
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.920
Both Kubernetes and OpenShift

25
00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.205
are container
orchestration platforms.

26
00:01:05.205 --> 00:01:08.635
Kubernetes is a critical
component of OpenShift.

27
00:01:08.635 --> 00:01:10.020
OpenShift is used as

28
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.000
an extension of
Kubernetes to provide

29
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.120
a more robust and
comprehensive platform

30
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.040
for containerized applications.

31
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.690
Let's review the
features of OpenShift.

32
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.630
Apps can scale to thousands of

33
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.330
instances across hundreds
of nodes in seconds.

34
00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.650
Flexible hybrid
infrastructure options

35
00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.105
simplify deployment
and management.

36
00:01:28.105 --> 00:01:30.090
Open source standards use

37
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.335
Kubernetes and Open
Container Initiative,

38
00:01:32.335 --> 00:01:35.110
OCI containers, which
means development is

39
00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.610
familiar and containers are

40
00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.305
portable across
multiple environments.

41
00:01:39.305 --> 00:01:42.745
It includes a comprehensive
set of developer tools,

42
00:01:42.745 --> 00:01:45.360
multi-language
support, command line,

43
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.980
IDE integrations, and more.

44
00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.940
It supports over air
platform upgrades,

45
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.300
and services from the
operator hub can be

46
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.580
fully configured and deployed
with one click upgrades.

47
00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.580
Container and app
builds, deployments,

48
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.600
scaling, and health management

49
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.625
are streamlined and automated.

50
00:02:03.625 --> 00:02:06.180
OpenShift also
enhances support for

51
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.220
smaller footprint topologies in

52
00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.360
edge scenarios for
better mapping,

53
00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.560
connectivity, and availability.

54
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.060
It easily manages and

55
00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.385
enforces policies across
multiple clusters at scale.

56
00:02:17.385 --> 00:02:19.240
It offers access controls,

57
00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.380
networking and
enterprise registry,

58
00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.060
built in scanner, enhanced
threat detection,

59
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.060
life cycle vulnerability
management, and risk profiling.

60
00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.880
OpenShift supports enterprise
persistent storage solutions

61
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.835
for running stateful
and stateless apps.

62
00:02:34.835 --> 00:02:37.500
The OpenShift partner ecosystem

63
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.120
provides additional storage
and network services,

64
00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.840
as well as IDE,

65
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.505
CI, integrations, and more.

66
00:02:44.505 --> 00:02:46.350
Let's compare the main aspects

67
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.665
between OpenShift
and Kubernetes.

68
00:02:48.665 --> 00:02:49.970
OpenShift is a product,

69
00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.670
while Kubernetes is an
open source project.

70
00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.710
Installation on OpenShift has

71
00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.470
limited options after
the installation starts,

72
00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.370
while Kubernetes is installable

73
00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.230
on every Linux environment.

74
00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.070
OpenShift is less flexible,

75
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.270
while Kubernetes
is more flexible.

76
00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.750
OpenShift is available online
with Azure and dedicated,

77
00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.450
while Kubernetes is
available on EKS,

78
00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.930
on AWS, GKE, on GCP,

79
00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.070
and AKS on Azure.

80
00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.590
OpenShift image streams
provide better management,

81
00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:20.990
while Kubernetes container

82
00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.140
image management
is not that easy.

83
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.010
OpenShift has a very
strict security policy,

84
00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.605
while Kubernetes security
maintenance is easy.

85
00:03:28.605 --> 00:03:31.830
OpenShift router objects
permit external access,

86
00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.870
while Kubernetes ingress objects

87
00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.830
permit external access
to Kubernetes clusters.

88
00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.590
OpenShift uses the less

89
00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.710
flexible deployment
config command,

90
00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:44.110
while Kubernetes uses more
flexible deployment objects.

91
00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.450
OpenShift provides a
good user experience,

92
00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.750
while Kubernetes
requires extra tools

93
00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.625
for a better user experience.

94
00:03:50.625 --> 00:03:52.880
OpenShift provides
good networking

95
00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.220
solutions out of the box,

96
00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.840
while Kubernetes provides
third party plugins

97
00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.880
when network solutions
are unavailable.

98
00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.520
OpenShift provides a
good service catalog,

99
00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.640
while Kubernetes
offers less provision

100
00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.780
for better services in clusters.

101
00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.840
OpenShift has a user
friendly web console layout

102
00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.885
that is easy to
learn for beginners,

103
00:04:10.885 --> 00:04:12.780
while Kubernetes console layout

104
00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.905
is difficult to
learn for beginners.

105
00:04:14.905 --> 00:04:19.315
The OpenShift CI and CD
integrate with Jenkins,

106
00:04:19.315 --> 00:04:22.720
while the Kubernetes CI
and CD can be integrated,

107
00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.020
but not with Jenkins.

108
00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.660
OpenShift runs on top of
a Kubernetes cluster,

109
00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.100
with object data stored in
the etcd key-value store.

110
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.210
It has a microservices-based
architecture.

111
00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.590
Its services are REST APIs,

112
00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.090
which expose the core
objects, and controllers,

113
00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.090
which read the REST APIs,

114
00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.390
apply changes to
the other objects,

115
00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:50.570
and report status or
write back to the object.

116
00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.650
They also maintain the
cluster desired state.

117
00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.250
Docker provides abstraction
for packaging and

118
00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.730
creating Linux-based
lightweight container images.

119
00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:02.190
Kubernetes provides
cluster management

120
00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.200
and orchestrates containers
on multiple hosts.

121
00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.150
OpenShift features add
management of source code,

122
00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.690
builds, and deployments
for developers,

123
00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.610
managing and promoting images

124
00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.950
at scale as they flow
through your system,

125
00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:18.390
application management at scale,

126
00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:20.530
team and user
tracking management

127
00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.770
of a large developer
organization,

128
00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.910
and networking infrastructure
that supports the cluster.

129
00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.435
In an OpenShift environment,

130
00:05:29.435 --> 00:05:31.400
the Kubernetes master runs on

131
00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.955
Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS,

132
00:05:33.955 --> 00:05:37.350
while worker nodes support
Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

133
00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:40.120
That is the Red Hat base layer.

134
00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.865
Next is the Kubernetes
architecture

135
00:05:42.865 --> 00:05:44.560
and a set of services.

136
00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.770
Cluster services include
integrated monitoring,

137
00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.050
a private registry
within the cluster,

138
00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.120
networking solutions,
and many others.

139
00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.830
Platform services help users
manage their workloads.

140
00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.850
Application services help
users build Cloud native apps.

141
00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:04.270
Developer services increase
developer productivity.

142
00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:07.610
OpenShift offers a set of
command line interface or

143
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:10.290
CLI tools that
lets users perform

144
00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:11.850
various admin and development

145
00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:13.460
operations from the terminal.

146
00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.490
OpenShift CLI or OC is

147
00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:18.830
the most commonly used CLI tool

148
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:21.210
to perform end-to-end
operations.

149
00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:24.430
It runs on Windows,
Linux, or Mac.

150
00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:26.270
OC lets you work

151
00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:29.430
directly with project source
code using command script,

152
00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:32.950
script OpenShift operations,
and manage projects

153
00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:34.390
during restricted bandwidth or

154
00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:36.595
availability of the web console.

155
00:06:36.595 --> 00:06:40.240
Since OpenShift runs on top
of a Kubernetes cluster,

156
00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.860
a copy of kubectl is
also included with OC.

157
00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:47.740
The OC and kubectl binary
offer the same capabilities,

158
00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.680
but OC is further extended to

159
00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.880
natively support
OpenShift features,

160
00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:54.560
such as deployment configs,

161
00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.740
build configs, routes,
image streams,

162
00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:59.565
and image stream tags.

163
00:06:59.565 --> 00:07:02.520
These are not available
in standard Kubernetes.

164
00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.095
OC also offers

165
00:07:04.095 --> 00:07:07.245
an inbuilt login command
for authentication.

166
00:07:07.245 --> 00:07:10.195
Additional commands like new app

167
00:07:10.195 --> 00:07:11.990
are also supported by OC,

168
00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:14.450
which makes it easier
to get new applications

169
00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:17.930
started using existing source
code or pre-built images.

170
00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:20.325
In this video, you learn that

171
00:07:20.325 --> 00:07:22.110
Kubernetes and OpenShift are

172
00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:24.275
container orchestration
platforms,

173
00:07:24.275 --> 00:07:26.390
OpenShift is an enterprise-ready

174
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:28.085
Kubernetes container platform

175
00:07:28.085 --> 00:07:30.265
built for open hybrid Cloud,

176
00:07:30.265 --> 00:07:32.835
OpenShift runs on a
Kubernetes cluster,

177
00:07:32.835 --> 00:07:36.810
with object data stored in
the etcd key-value store,

178
00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:39.720
and OpenShift is easier to use,

179
00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.275
integrates with Jenkins,

180
00:07:41.275 --> 00:07:44.460
and has more services
and features.
