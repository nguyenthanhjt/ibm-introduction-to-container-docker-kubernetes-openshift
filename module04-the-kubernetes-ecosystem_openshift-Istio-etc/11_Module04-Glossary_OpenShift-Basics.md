| **A/B testing**                | Strategy mostly used for testing new features in front-end applications. It evaluates two versions of the application, A and B, to assess which performs better in a controlled environment. These versions differ in terms of features and target different user sets. Based on user interaction and feedback, one version can be selected for global deployment into production. |
| **Build**                      | The process of transforming inputs into a resultant object.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **BuildConfig**                | An OpenShift-specific object that defines the process for a build to follow. The build process uses the input sources and the build strategy. The BuildConfig is the blueprint, and the build is an instance of that blueprint.                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Canary Deployments**         | A strategy that deploys a new version of an application by gradually increasing the number of users. Canary deployment uses real users to test the new version of the application, allowing bugs and issues to be detected before the version is deployed globally.                                                                                                                |
| **Circuit breaking**           | A method to prevent errors in one microservice from cascading to other microservices.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Configuration Change**       | A trigger that causes a new build to run when a new BuildConfig resource is created.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Control Plane**              | The control plane takes the desired configuration and its view of the services and dynamically programs and updates the proxy servers as the environment changes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Custom build strategy**      | Requires you to define and create your own builder image.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Custom builder images**      | Regular Docker images that contain the logic needed to transform the inputs into the expected output.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **CRDs**                       | Custom code that defines a resource to add to your Kubernetes API server without building a complete custom server.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Custom controllers**         | Reconcile the custom resources (CRDs) actual state with its desired state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Data plane**                 | Handles communication between services. If a service mesh is absent, the network cannot identify traffic type, source, and destination, and make necessary decisions.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Enforceability (Control)**   | Istio provides control by enforcing policies across an entire fleet and ensures resources are fairly distributed among consumers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Envoy proxy**                | All network traffic is intercepted by a proxy, called Envoy, used by the service mesh and allows many features depending on the configuration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Human operators**            | Understand the systems they control. They know how to deploy services and how to recognize and fix problems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Image Change**               | A trigger to rebuild a containerized application when a new or updated version of an image is available. For example, if an application is built using a Node.js base image, that image will be updated as security fixes are released.                                                                                                                                            |
| **ImageStream**                | An abstraction for referencing container images within OpenShift. ImageStreams do not contain image data but rather pointers to image digests.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **ImageStream Tag**            | An identity to the pointer in an ImageStream that points to a certain image in a registry.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Istio**                      | A platform-independent service mesh used with Kubernetes. It controls traffic and API calls between services, runs tests, and reduces network complexity. It secures services and provides control by enforcing policies across a fleet. It also provides observability of traffic flow, latency, and errors.                                                                      |
| **Man-in-the-middle attacks**  | A type of cyber-attack where an attacker secretly intercepts and relays messages between two parties who believe they are communicating directly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Observability**              | Helps to observe the traffic flow in your mesh, trace call flows and dependencies, and view metrics such as latency and errors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **OpenShift**                  | A hybrid cloud, enterprise Kubernetes application.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **OpenShift CI/CD process**    | Automatically merges new code changes to the repository, builds, tests, approves, and deploys a new version to different environments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Operators**                  | Automate cluster tasks and act as a custom controller to extend the Kubernetes API.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
