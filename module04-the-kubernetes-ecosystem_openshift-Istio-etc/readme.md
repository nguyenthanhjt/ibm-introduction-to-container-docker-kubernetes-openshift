# Module 2: The Kubernetes Ecosystem: OpenShift, Istio, etc.

Learn more about the growing Kubernetes ecosystem and explore additional tools that work well with Kubernetes to support cloud-native development. You’ll gain an understanding of the similarities and differences between Red Hat ® OpenShift® and Kubernetes and see what OpenShift architecture looks like. You’ll learn about OpenShift builds and BuildConfigs, and OpenShift build strategies and triggers. You'll also discover how operators can deploy whole applications with ease. Finally, you’ll examine how the Istio service mesh manages and secures traffic and communication between an application’s services. At the end of the week, you’ll use the oc CLI to perform commands on an OpenShift cluster. And you’ll use the OpenShift build capabilities to deploy an application from source code stored in a Git repository.

**Learning Objectives**

* Examine a BuildConfig and an ImageStream.
* Build and deploy an application using s2i.
* Use the oc CLI.
* Describe the capabilities Istio provides and why these capabilities are important for microservices.
* Explain what an operator is and how operators help automate tasks within a cluster.
* Explain the OpenShift build strategies and the three build triggers that stipulate when a build should run.
* Describe the relationship between Red Hat OpenShift and Kubernetes, as well as their similarities and differences.
