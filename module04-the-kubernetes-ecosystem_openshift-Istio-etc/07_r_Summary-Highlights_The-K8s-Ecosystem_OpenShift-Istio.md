# Module 4 - Section 07 - Summary & Highlights: The Kubernetes Ecosystem: OpenShift, Istio, etc.

- **OpenShiftÂ®** is an enterprise-ready Kubernetes container platform built for open hybrid cloud.
- **OpenShift** is easier to use, integrates with Jenkins, and has more services and features.
- **Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)** extend the Kubernetes API.
- CRDs paired with custom controllers create new, declarative APIs in Kubernetes.
- **Operators** use CRDs and custom controllers to automate cluster tasks.
- A **build** is a process that transforms inputs into an object.
- An **ImageStream** is an abstraction for referencing container images in OpenShift.
- A **service mesh** provides:
  - Traffic management to control the flow of traffic between services.
  - Security to encrypt traffic between services.
  - Observability of service behavior to troubleshoot and optimize applications.
- **Istio** is a service mesh that supports four concepts: connection, security, enforcement, and observability. It is commonly used with Microservices applications.
