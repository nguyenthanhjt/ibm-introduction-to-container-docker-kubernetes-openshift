# Module 1: Containers and Containerization

In week two, learn what container orchestration is. Then, explore how developers can use container orchestration to create and manage complex container environment development lifecycles. Kubernetes is currently the most popular container orchestration platform. You’ll examine key Kubernetes architectural components, including control plane components and controllers. Explore Kubernetes objects, and learn how specific Kubernetes objects such as Pods, ReplicaSets, and Deployments work. Then, learn how developers use the Kubernetes command line interface (CLI), or “kubectl” to manipulate objects, manage workloads in a Kubernetes cluster, and apply basic kubectl commands. You’ll be able to differentiate the benefits and drawbacks of using imperative and declarative commands. At the end of this module, you will use the kubectl CLI commands to create resources on an actual Kubernetes cluster. At the end of this week, you’ll use the Kubernetes CLI to create a Kubernetes pod, create a Kubernetes deployment, create a ReplicaSet and see Kubernetes load balancing in action.

**Learning Objectives**

- Monitor Kubernetes load balancing.
- Create a ReplicaSet that maintains a set number of replicas.
- Create a Kubernetes Pod (using an imperative command, an imperative object configuration, and a declarative object configuration).
- Use the kubectl CLI.
- Describe how specific Kubernetes objects such as Pods, ReplicaSets, and Deployments work.
- Explain how imperative and declarative commands work, as well as the benefits and shortcomings of each.
- List some of the basic commands of kubectl CLI.
- Describe what the Kubernetes CLI or kubectl is and the functionality this tool provides for working with Kubernetes clusters.
- Explain what Kubernetes objects are.
- Identify tools, platforms, and services within the Kubernetes ecosystem, and their providers.
- Explain what Kubernetes is, how it works, and what makes it the most popular container orchestration platform.
- List the components of the Kubernetes control planes and nodes and explain how they work.
- Describe the architecture of a Kubernetes cluster.
- Summarize container orchestration and its benefits.
