# Conclusion

In this module, you have learned how to manage applications with Kubernetes, including setting up the environment, building and deploying applications, and implementing autoscaling using both Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) and Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA). Additionally, you have learned how to securely manage sensitive information using Kubernetes Secrets.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Environment Setup**:
    - Verified `kubectl` version.
    - Cloned the project repository.

2. **Building and Deploying Applications**:
    - Built Docker images and pushed them to a container registry.
    - Deployed applications using Kubernetes deployment configurations.

3. **Autoscaling**:
    - Implemented Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) to manage resource requests and limits.
    - Configured Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to scale the number of pod replicas based on CPU utilization.

4. **Managing Secrets**:
    - Created Kubernetes Secrets to store sensitive information.
    - Updated deployments to utilize these secrets securely.

By mastering these concepts, you are now equipped to efficiently manage and scale applications in a Kubernetes environment, ensuring optimal resource utilization and security.
