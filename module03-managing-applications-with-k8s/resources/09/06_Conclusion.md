# Conclusion

In this lab, you began by building and deploying an application called myapp on Kubernetes.
Following this, you configured a Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) to automatically adjust resource requests and limits for the myapp deployment.
Subsequently, you implemented a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to scale the number of replicas for the myapp deployment based on CPU utilization.
Finally, you created a Secret and updated the myapp deployment to utilize it.
