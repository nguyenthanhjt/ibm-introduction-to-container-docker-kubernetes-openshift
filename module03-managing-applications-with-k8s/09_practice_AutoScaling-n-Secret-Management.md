# Module 3 - Section 9: Practice Lab - AutoScaling and Secret Management

This practice lab is designed to provide hands-on experience with Kubernetes, focusing on vertical and horizontal pod autoscaling and secrets management.

## Objectives

In this practice lab, you will:

- Build and deploy an application to Kubernetes
- Implement Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) to adjust pod resource requests/limits
- Implement Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to scale the number of pod replicas based on resource utilization
- Create a Secret and update the deployment for using it

> **Note:** Kindly complete the lab in a single session without any break because the lab may go in offline mode and cause errors. If you face any issues/errors during the lab process, please logout from the lab environment. Then, clear your system cache and cookies and try to complete the lab.
