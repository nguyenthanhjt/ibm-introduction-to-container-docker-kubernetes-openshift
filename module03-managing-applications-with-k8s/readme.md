# Module 3: Managing Applications with Kubernetes

Explore ReplicaSets, autoscaling, rolling updates, ConfigMaps, Secrets, and service bindings, and learn how you can use these capabilities to manage Kubernetes applications. You’ll learn how ReplicaSets scale applications to meet increasing demand, and how autoscaling creates dynamic demand-based scaling. You’ll see how to use rolling updates to publish application updates and roll back changes without interrupting the user experience. You’ll learn how to use ConfigMaps and Secrets to provide configuration variables and sensitive information to your deployments and to keep your code clean. At the end of the week, you’ll scale and update applications deployed in Kubernetes.

**Learning Objectives**

- Explain the different types of deployment strategies and when each should be used.
- Explain how to bind an external service to your deployment.
- Explain what a Secret is, the different ways to create a Secret, and how to use it to provide sensitive information to your application.
- Describe what a ConfigMap is and the different ways in which you can create ConfigMaps.
- Explain how to use rolling updates to publish and revert changes made to your application.
- Discuss what autoscaling is and how it can be used to dynamically scale an application.
- Explain how to create a ReplicaSet using the CLI and a YAML file.
- Describe how a ReplicaSet is used to scale your application.
