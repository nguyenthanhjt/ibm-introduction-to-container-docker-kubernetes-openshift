# Module 1 | Part 1 | Section 1 - Video: Course Introduction

## Introduction

This video introduces the course on Containers, Kubernetes, and OpenShift.

It provides an overview of the topics that will be covered and sets the stage for the learning journey ahead.

## Key Points

- **Kubernetes**: An open-source platform for orchestrating running containers, developed by Google in 2015.
- **Cloud Native Computing Foundation Survey**: In 2019, a survey showed a significant increase in interest in cloud-native computing technologies.
- **Kubernetes Popularity**: Kubernetes is the third largest platform for the number of committers on GitHub and the second largest for issues and pull requests, following the Linux Kernel.
- **Ecosystem**: A thriving ecosystem surrounds Kubernetes, including applications for cloud security, service mesh, and other cloud-native technologies.
- **De Facto Standards**: Kubernetes and Containers have become the de facto standards for cloud-native applications and are foundational for any cloud computing-related learning.

## Learning Objectives

- Introduction to Containers, Docker, and container registries.
- Understanding the need for container orchestration with Kubernetes.
- Learning about Kubernetes architecture and resources.
- Deploying a working application using Kubernetes.
- Exploring the Kubernetes ecosystem, including Red Hat OpenShift and Istio.

## Prerequisites

- Basic computer and cloud literacy.
- Understanding of core cloud concepts.
- Familiarity with the command line and shell commands.

## Hands-on Labs
The course includes several hands-on labs to help you apply the content you learn. If you do not have the resources to set up a Kubernetes cluster, the course provides an environment free of charge to complete the labs.
