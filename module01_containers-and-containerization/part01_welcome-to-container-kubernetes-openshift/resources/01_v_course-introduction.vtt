00:00:07.144 --> 00:00:11.344
Welcome to this introductory course on Containers and Kubernetes.

3
00:00:11.344 --> 00:00:14.417
My name is Alex Parker and I'm Upkar Lidder.

4
00:00:14.417 --> 00:00:19.819
This course was made for anybody who wants to learn how to design, develop, deploy, manage

5
00:00:19.819 --> 00:00:23.775
secure applications on public, private, and
hybrid cloud platforms.

6
00:00:23.775 --> 00:00:28.779
By the end of this course, you will not only
have a running application on public cloud

7
00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.532
but also have a really good understanding
of Kubernetes and Containers.

8
00:00:32.532 --> 00:00:38.212
Containerization is not a new technology,
but it rose to greater prominence in 2013

9
00:00:38.212 --> 00:00:41.253
with the release of Docker, and it hasn't
stopped growing since.

10
00:00:41.253 --> 00:00:46.925
In fact, containers have become the technology
for modern cloud native development.

11
00:00:47.244 --> 00:00:53.687
The analyst firm Gartner predicts that by
2023 over 70 percent of global organizations

12
00:00:53.687 --> 00:00:57.325
will be running more than two
containerized applications in production,

13
00:00:57.325 --> 00:01:01.063
up from less than twenty percent in 2019.

14
00:01:01.063 --> 00:01:07.052
The Cloud Native Computing Foundation known as CNCF conducts annual surveys to discern

15
00:01:07.052 --> 00:01:11.003
where and how cloud native technologies are being adopted.

16
00:01:11.003 --> 00:01:17.250
The 2019 survey indicates that 84 percent
of respondents are using containers in production

17
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:24.826
up from 74 percent in 2018; and 23 percent in the first survey in 2016.

18
00:01:24.826 --> 00:01:30.562
These trends clearly demonstrate that containers
aren't a passing fad or a niche technology

19
00:01:30.562 --> 00:01:35.840
but an industry changing revolution that will
impact organizations small and large, and

20
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.461
developers worldwide.

21
00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:43.709
Likewise, Kubernetes, an open source platform for orchestrating running containers was developed

22
00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:48.000
and contributed to the open source community by Google in 2015.

23
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.360
The Cloud Native Computing Foundation did a survey in 2019 and found that the number

24
00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:58.379
of users or respondents who were interested in cloud native computing technologies went

25
00:01:58.379 --> 00:02:02.519
up from 58 percent to 78 percent from the
previous year.

26
00:02:02.724 --> 00:02:08.164
Kubernetes is the third largest platform for number of committers on GitHub as well as

27
00:02:08.164 --> 00:02:13.394
second largest for a number of issues and pull requests only after the Linux Kernel.

28
00:02:13.918 --> 00:02:19.251
A thriving ecosystem surrounds the open source Kubernetes platform including applications

29
00:02:19.251 --> 00:02:24.404
for cloud security, service mesh as well as other cloud native technologies.

30
00:02:24.826 --> 00:02:29.691
As a result of these things, Kubernetes and Containers have become the de facto standards

31
00:02:29.691 --> 00:02:34.431
when talking about cloud native applications, also making them the foundation for any cloud

32
00:02:34.431 --> 00:02:36.000
computing related learning.

33
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.460
This course will introduce you to Containers, Docker, and container registries, to get you

34
00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.119
started with the foundations of this technology.

35
00:02:44.386 --> 00:02:49.042
Then you'll learn about the need for container orchestration in Kubernetes specifically,

36
00:02:49.042 --> 00:02:53.783
including its architecture, the different
resources you can deploy in Kubernetes, and

37
00:02:53.783 --> 00:02:58.043
how to put those pieces together to deploy a working application.

38
00:02:58.043 --> 00:03:03.000
And finally, you'll learn about the Kubernetes ecosystem, including Red Hat OpenShift and

39
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.210
Istio, and how these tools can make your journey to containerization, and your subsequent use

40
00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:10.460
of containers so much better.

41
00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:14.700
The course contains several hands-on labs that will help you apply the content you learn.

42
00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:19.548
If you do not have the resources to set up
a Kubernetes cluster, the course will provide

43
00:03:19.548 --> 00:03:23.892
an environment free of charge which will help you to finish the labs.

44
00:03:23.892 --> 00:03:28.753
The prerequisites for this course include
basic computer and cloud literacy,

45
00:03:29.026 --> 00:03:32.584
as well as an understanding of core cloud
concepts.

46
00:03:32.584 --> 00:03:37.442
In addition, understanding of the command line and how to use shell commands will greatly

47
00:03:37.442 --> 00:03:39.574
benefit you during this course.

48
00:03:39.574 --> 00:03:40.813
Let's get started!

49
00:03:40.813 --> 00:03:42.000
