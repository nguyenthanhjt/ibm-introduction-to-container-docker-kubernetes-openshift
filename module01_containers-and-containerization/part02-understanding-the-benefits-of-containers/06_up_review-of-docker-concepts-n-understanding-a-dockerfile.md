# Docker Concepts

## Overview
Docker simplifies the process of creating, deploying, and managing applications by using containers. Containers allow you to package an application with its dependencies into a standardized unit for software development. Docker provides tools and a platform to build, ship, and run containers across various environments.

## Dockerfile
A text file that contains instructions for building a Docker image. It specifies the base image, sets the working directory, installs dependencies, copies application code, exposes ports, and defines commands to run the application.

## Container
An instance of a Docker image that runs as a process on the host machine. Containers are lightweight, portable, and isolated, making them ideal for deploying and scaling applications.

## Docker Image Storage
Docker images are stored in registries, which can be public or private. Public registries like Docker Hub host millions of images, while organizations often use private registries for security and control.

## Where Docker Images Exist
- **Local Machine**: When you build a Docker image, it's initially stored locally on your machine. You can list local Docker images using the `docker images` command.
- **Registry**: After building, you can push Docker images to a registry, making them accessible from anywhere with access to that registry.

# Dockerfile

Below is a sample Dockerfile for reference. The subsequent explanation details the commands used, providing a comprehensive understanding of how to write a Dockerfile.

```Dockerfile
# Use the official Node.js image as the base image
FROM node:14

# Set environment variables
ENV NODE_ENV=production
ENV PORT=3000

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json files
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install --production

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Add additional file
ADD public/index.html /app/public/index.html

# Expose the port on which the application will run
EXPOSE $PORT

# Specify the default command to run when the container starts
CMD ["node", "app.js"]

# Labeling the image
LABEL version="1.0"
LABEL description="Node.js application Docker image"
LABEL maintainer="Your Name"

# Healthcheck to ensure the container is running correctly
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --start-period=5s --retries=3 CMD curl -fs http://localhost:$PORT || exit 1

# Set a non-root user for security purposes
USER node
```

# Understanding the Dockerfile

1. **Specify the Base Image**  
   To begin, specify the base image using the `FROM` instruction. In this case, the official Node.js image version 14 is used.

   ```Dockerfile
   FROM node:14
   ```

   - `FROM`: Specifies the base image for the Docker container.
   - `node:14`: Pulls the official Node.js image with version 14 from the Docker registry.

2. **Set Environment Variables**  
   Next, define the necessary environment variables with the `ENV` instruction. Here, `NODE_ENV` is set to production and `PORT` is set to 3000.

   ```Dockerfile
   ENV NODE_ENV=production
   ENV PORT=3000
   ```

   - `ENV`: Sets environment variables inside the Docker container.
   - `NODE_ENV=production`: Sets the Node.js environment to production.
   - `PORT=3000`: Sets the port on which the Node.js application will listen.

3. **Set the Working Directory**  
   Then, specify the working directory inside the container using the `WORKDIR` instruction. This sets `/app` as the working directory.

   ```Dockerfile
   WORKDIR /usr/src/app
   ```

   - `WORKDIR`: Defines the working directory for subsequent instructions, simplifying file path references.
   - `/usr/src/app`: The directory inside the container to store your application code, keeping it organized and easily accessible.

4. **Copy Package Files**  
   After defining the working directory, use the `COPY` instruction to copy the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files into the container. These files are essential for installing the application dependencies.

   ```Dockerfile
   COPY package*.json ./
   ```

   - `COPY`: Copies files from your local machine to the container.
   - `package*.json ./`: Copies both `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files.

5. **Install Dependencies**  
   With the package files copied, execute the `RUN` instruction to install the production dependencies listed in `package.json`.

   ```Dockerfile
   RUN npm install --production
   ```

   - `RUN`: Executes commands in the container during the build process.
   - `npm install --production`: Installs dependencies listed in `package.json` without devDependencies.

6. **Copy Application Code**  
   Once the dependencies are installed, copy the rest of the application code into the container using the `COPY` instruction.

   ```Dockerfile
   COPY . .
   ```

   - `COPY . .`: Copies all files and directories from the current directory on the local host to the current directory in the Docker container.

7. **Add Additional File(s)**  
   Additionally, use the `ADD` instruction to include any extra files. Here, the `index.html` file is added to the public directory.

   ```Dockerfile
   ADD public/index.html /app/public/index.html
   ```

   - `public/index.html`: Path to the file or directory on the host machine.
   - `/app/public/index.html`: Path where you want to add the file or directory inside the Docker image.

8. **Expose the Application Port**  
   Next, inform Docker that the container listens on the specified port with the `EXPOSE` instruction. Here, it exposes the port defined by the `PORT` environment variable.

   ```Dockerfile
   EXPOSE $PORT
   ```

   - `EXPOSE`: Informs Docker that the container will listen on the specified port at runtime.
   - `$PORT`: The environment variable representing the port number defined earlier.

9. **Specify the Default Command**  
   Define the default command to run when the container starts using the `CMD` instruction. Here, it runs `node app.js`.

   ```Dockerfile
   CMD ["node", "app.js"]
   ```

   - `CMD`: This instruction specifies the default command and/or parameters to execute at the entry point of the container.
   - `["node", "app.js"]`: This array specifies the command to run any arguments for that command. In this case, it tells Docker to execute the node command with `app.js` as the argument.

   _Note: The filename `app.js` is commonly used as the main file for Node.js applications. However, depending on your project structure or naming conventions, the main file could have a different name._

10. **Label the Image**  
    Then, add metadata to the image with the `LABEL` instruction, including the version, description, and maintainer information.

    ```Dockerfile
    LABEL version="1.0"
    LABEL description="Node.js application Docker image"
    LABEL maintainer="Your Name"
    ```

    - `LABEL`: Adds metadata to the Docker image.
    - `version="1.0"`: Specifies the version of the Docker image.
    - `description="Node.js application Docker image"`: Provides a description of the Docker image.
    - `maintainer="Your Name"`: Specifies the maintainer of the Docker image.

11. **Add a Healthcheck**  
    For ensuring the container is running correctly, define a health check using the `HEALTHCHECK` instruction. This command checks the applicationâ€™s health by sending a request to the specified port.

    ```Dockerfile
    HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --start-period=5s --retries=3 CMD curl -fs http://localhost:$PORT || exit 1
    ```

    - `HEALTHCHECK`: Configures a health check to ensure the container is running correctly.
    - `--interval=30s`: Specifies the interval between health checks.
    - `--timeout=10s`: Sets the timeout for each health check.
    - `--start-period=5s`: Defines the start period during which the container must initialize before health checks begin.
    - `--retries=3`: Sets the number of retries before considering the container unhealthy.
    - `CMD curl -fs http://localhost:$PORT || exit 1`: Specifies the command to run for health checks. It checks if a request to `http://localhost:$PORT` succeeds; otherwise, it exits with code 1, indicating failure.

12. **Set a Non-Root User**  
    Finally, for security purposes, set a non-root user with the `USER` instruction. Here, the user is set to `node`.

    ```Dockerfile
    USER node
    ```

    - `USER`: Sets the user that will run the subsequent instructions in the Dockerfile.
    - `node`: Specifies the user named `node` to run the commands for security purposes.

This step-by-step explanation shows the flow of creating a Dockerfile, highlighting how each instruction builds upon the previous one to create a fully functional Docker image.
