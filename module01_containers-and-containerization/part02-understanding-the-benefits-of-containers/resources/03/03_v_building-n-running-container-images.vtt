[MUSIC]
Welcome to building and

2
00:00:08.936 --> 00:00:10.214
running containers.

3
00:00:10.214 --> 00:00:12.111
After watching this video,

4
00:00:12.111 --> 00:00:16.302
you will be able build a container
image using a Dockerfile.

5
00:00:16.302 --> 00:00:21.534
Create a running container using an image
and describe key Docker commands.

6
00:00:21.534 --> 00:00:25.542
This diagram shows the development
process of a running container.

7
00:00:25.542 --> 00:00:27.081
The steps to create and

8
00:00:27.081 --> 00:00:32.916
run containers create a dockerfile use the
dockerfile to create a container image and

9
00:00:32.916 --> 00:00:37.034
use the container image to
create a running container.

10
00:00:37.034 --> 00:00:40.394
Use a Dockerfile to create
a running container.

11
00:00:40.394 --> 00:00:44.954
This sample docker file has
the commands from and CMD.

12
00:00:44.954 --> 00:00:51.546
From defines the base image and CMD prints
the words hello world on the terminal.

13
00:00:51.546 --> 00:00:55.784
You'll notice that this Docker command
uses the build command, the tag,

14
00:00:55.784 --> 00:00:59.384
the repository, the version,
and the current directory.

15
00:00:59.384 --> 00:01:04.489
After you run this build, the output
messages include sending build context to

16
00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.899
Docker Daemon, successfully built <image>,
which confirms image creation and

17
00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:13.720
successfully tagged my-app,
which confirms the tag.

18
00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.024
To verify the creation of the image,
run the docker images command.

19
00:01:18.024 --> 00:01:23.132
The output displays the repository,
my-app, as well as the tag,

20
00:01:23.132 --> 00:01:27.674
v1, image ID, creation date,
and the image size.

21
00:01:27.674 --> 00:01:29.866
Create the container
using the run command.

22
00:01:29.866 --> 00:01:35.834
With the container image name and tag, the
application prints the words hello world.

23
00:01:35.834 --> 00:01:38.096
Execute the Docker PSA command,

24
00:01:38.096 --> 00:01:42.010
which displays the details
of the container created.

25
00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:43.978
Given the appropriate input.

26
00:01:43.978 --> 00:01:47.904
The build command is used to create
container images with tags from

27
00:01:47.904 --> 00:01:49.124
a docker file.

28
00:01:49.124 --> 00:01:53.809
The images command will list all
the images, their repositories and

29
00:01:53.809 --> 00:01:55.700
tags, and their sizes.

30
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.684
The run command creates and
runs a container from an image.

31
00:01:59.684 --> 00:02:03.385
The push command stores images
in a configured registry,

32
00:02:03.385 --> 00:02:08.164
and the pull command retrieves
images from a configured registry.

33
00:02:08.164 --> 00:02:12.532
In this video, you learned that
the build command is used with

34
00:02:12.532 --> 00:02:15.618
a Dockerfile to build a container image.

35
00:02:15.618 --> 00:02:20.226
The run command is used with an image
to create a running container and key.

36
00:02:20.226 --> 00:02:25.314
Dockerfile commands include build,
images, run, pull, and push.
