# Build an Image Using a Dockerfile

1. The current working directory contains a simple Node.js application that will be run in a container. The app will print a hello message along with the hostname. The following files are needed to run the app in a container:

   - Refer repository [CC201](./CC201) or [Github](https://github.com/ibm-developer-skills-network/CC201.git) for the artifacts needed for this lab.
     - `app.js`: The main application, which simply replies with a hello world message.
     - `package.json`: Defines the dependencies of the application.
     - `Dockerfile`: Defines the instructions Docker uses to build the image.

2. Use the Explorer to view the files. Click the Explorer icon (it looks like a sheet of paper) on the left side of the window, and then navigate to the directory for this lab: `CC201 > labs > 1_ContainersAndDocker`. Click `Dockerfile` to view the commands required to build an image.

   ```bash
   FROM node:9.4.0-alpine
    COPY app.js .
    COPY package.json .
    RUN npm install &&\
        apk update &&\
        apk upgrade
    EXPOSE  8080
    CMD node app.js
   ```
   - **Dockerfile in Explorer**:
     - You can refresh your understanding of the commands mentioned in the Dockerfile below:
       - **`FROM`**: Initializes a new build stage and specifies the base image that subsequent instructions will build upon.
       - **`COPY`**: Enables copying files to the image.
       - **`RUN`**: Executes commands.
       - **`EXPOSE`**: Exposes a particular port with a specified protocol inside a Docker Container.
       - **`CMD`**: Provides a default for executing a container, or in other words, an executable that should run in your container.

3. **Build the Image**:
   ```bash
   docker build . -t myimage:v1

   - As seen in the module videos, the output creates a new layer for each instruction in the Dockerfile.

4. **List Images to See Your Image Tagged `myimage:v1` in the Table**:
   ```bash
   docker images
   #output
    REPOSITORY    TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
    myimage       v1        19c0a353efc5   43 seconds ago   77.5MB
    hello-world   latest    d2c94e258dcb   15 months ago    13.3kB
   ```

   - Note that compared to the `hello-world` image, this image has a different image ID. This means that the two images consist of different layers â€“ in other words, they're not the same image.
