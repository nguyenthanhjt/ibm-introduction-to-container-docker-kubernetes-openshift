# Introduction to Containers, Docker, and IBM Cloud Container Registry

## Objectives
In this lab, you will:

- Pull an image from Docker Hub.
- Run an image as a container using Docker.
- Build an image using a Dockerfile.
- Push an image to IBM Cloud Container Registry.

> **Note**: Kindly complete the lab in a single session without any break because the lab may go offline and cause errors. If you face any issues/errors during the lab process, please log out from the lab environment, clear your system cache and cookies, and then try to complete the lab.

**Important**:

- You may already have an IBM Cloud account and a namespace in the IBM Container Registry (ICR). However, in this lab, you will not be using your own IBM Cloud account or your own ICR namespace.
- You will be using an IBM Cloud account that has been automatically generated for you for this exercise.
- The lab environment will not have access to any resources within your personal IBM Cloud account, including ICR namespaces and images.
